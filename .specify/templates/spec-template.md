# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- How does the rename plan handle conflicting target names or read-only files?
- What is the expected behavior when the `.renamer` ledger is missing, corrupted, or out of sync?
- How are case-only renames or Unicode normalization differences managed across platforms?
- What feedback is provided when an extension filter yields zero matches or contains invalid tokens?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: CLI MUST generate a deterministic preview of all pending renames before execution.
- **FR-002**: Users MUST confirm the preview (or abort) prior to any filesystem changes.
- **FR-003**: The tool MUST append every confirmed batch to the `.renamer` ledger with sufficient metadata for undo.
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to undo the most recent batch safely, even across process restarts.
- **FR-005**: CLI MUST support directory targeting (`-d`) and optional recursive traversal (`-r`) with clear scope boundaries.
- **FR-006**: CLI MUST accept an extension filter flag (`-e`) that parses `.`-prefixed, `|`-delimited extensions and applies the filter consistently across preview, execute, and undo flows.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-007**: CLI MUST support additional rename rule `[RULE_NAME]` [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: inputs/outputs not defined]
- **FR-008**: CLI MUST expose automation-friendly output [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: format (JSON, plain text) undecided]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **RenameBatch**: Represents a single preview/execute cycle; attributes include rules applied, timestamp, working directory, and file mappings.
- **RuleDefinition**: Captures configuration for a rename rule (inputs, validations, dependencies) without binding to implementation.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]
